  "audio_transcript": "so the electron transport chain we have what's called nadh and fadh2 they carry the hydrogen's in the high-energy electrons into this little system now I'm not worried about nadh and fadh2 but I just want you to know the third step is called the electron transport chain and this is where you're going to see a teepee really get produced on this is like hit the jackpot and so now we have a special thing I showed it in class ATP synthase which is literally a molecular motor it is a turnstile and as these electrons that have been trapped between the two membranes in the little bar that it rotates so this is the first step of the aerobic respiration",
