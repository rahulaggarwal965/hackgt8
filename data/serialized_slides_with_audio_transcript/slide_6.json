  "audio_transcript": "now glycolysis again is a pretty complicated thing it says there's a series of 10 reactions I am not worried about all of these reactions what I want you to remember is glyco license right we said license means to break down glyco is talkin about glucose so glycolysis is simply breaking down glucose it happens in the cytosol the site inside the the the the liquid of the cell so as soon as it comes in it's going to be broke again I'm not going to test you on that",
